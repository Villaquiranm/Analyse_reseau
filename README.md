# Session 1

## Requirements

  - [Python3] 
  - [SimPy] discrete-event simulation library
  - [Matplotlib] or any other 2D plotting library

## Installation

Install python 3.6:

```sh
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.6
```

Check if installation succeeded, the following command should display your python version:
```sh
$ python3.6 --version
```
Install python packet management system PIP:

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

Install the libraries:

```sh
$ sudo pip3 install -U simpy matplotlib
```

## Homework 
- Write a SimPy program that simulates a Poisson packet arrival process with intensity \lambda = 15 packets per second
- What is the observed average packet rate ? 
- What is the 95% confidence interval ?

# Session 2

- The "two routers" problem with and without collision are presented in the slides named "exo2.pdf"
- The homework is due by the 23/11/18 before midnight.

## Homework

* Complete the implementation of the queue simulation API
* Using the API, implement the two routers problem **without collision**. Then, for \lambda_1=\lambda_2= 7.5 packets per second, simulate and compute the following (in the stationary regime):
    * The average packet rate at the output of both routers. What can you conclude about the sum of two independent Poisson processes ?
    * The average latency. What is the **99%** confidence interval ?
* Using the API, implement the two routers problem **with collision**. Then, for \lambda_1=\lambda_2= 7.5 packets per second, simulate and compute the following (in the stationary regime):
    * The average latency. What is the 99% confidence interval ?
    * The average packet drop ratio for each router (number of packets received/number of packets sent). What is the **99%** confidence interval ?
